# 🕹️ The Pong Game (MATLAB)

This project is a classic **two-player Pong game** developed using **MATLAB**, designed as part of the *Numerical Technique Laboratory (EEE 212)* coursework at BUET. The game features a user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and allows players to enjoy simple but competitive gameplay on a single device.

## 🎯 Objective

To create an interactive and enjoyable two-player Ping Pong game using MATLAB that:

* Offers real-time keyboard control for both players.
* Tracks scores and declares the winner.
* Provides adjustable difficulty levels and a pause/resume mechanism.

## ⚙️ Features

* Two-player simultaneous gameplay.
* Keyboard controls:

  * **Player 1**: Right & Left arrow keys.
  * **Player 2**: 'A' and 'D' keys.
* In-game **pause**, **exit**, and **difficulty level selection**.
* **Real-time score display** and automatic **winner declaration**.
* GUI-based control for easier navigation and interaction.

## 🧠 Game Logic

* Ball movement is governed by basic 2D collision physics.
* When the ball hits a wall, it reflects horizontally.
* When it hits a bat, it bounces back; if missed, the opponent gains a point.
* First player to reach the fixed winning score is declared the winner.

## 🎨 GUI Components

* **Start Button**
* **Score Display**
* **Difficulty Level Dropdown**
* **Pause/Resume**
* **Exit Game**

## 📈 Accuracy & Limitations

The game accurately tracks scores and determines winners. However, improvements can be made:

* Enhanced visuals or customizable themes.
* Background music or sound effects.
* Multiplayer over network (future scope).

## 🧩 Applications

* A lightweight and fun entertainment option for kids and beginners.
* A useful introduction to GUI programming and 2D game development in MATLAB.
